# Team-8-Tasks

This repository contains a task app for Paly Robotics. Users can enter the subteam, management, or special operation that they are in and post tasks that need to be accomplished, with their due dates. Tasks can be marked as completed, ongoing, or are marked as overdue when they pass the due date. In the very near future, slack webhook notifications for tasks will be implemented.
